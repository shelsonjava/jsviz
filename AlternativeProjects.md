JSViz is best suited for projects that:
  * Require dynamic layouts, based on connected graphs
  * Demand fast load time, even for first-time visitors
  * Require support for graph nodes implemented as SVG or HTML elements
  * Prefer to integrate with a JavaScript implementation
  * Have low graph scalability requirements (around 100-200 nodes/graph)

If your project has different requirements, you may consider these alternative projects:
